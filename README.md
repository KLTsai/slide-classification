# Offer Slide Classification

## Introduction

This project leverages a machine learning solution to automatically classify presentation slides (.pptx) by analyzing both text and images, aiming to **verify results in organizations from searching** and **reduce manual labeling**.

## Objectives

- Integrate textual and visual information for slide classification.
- Evaluate and compare baseline and advanced machine learning models.
- Conclude optimal parameters combination for baseline and advanced approaches.
- Integrated CI/CD pipeline  into an application

## Key Tool & Libraries Used

- [`python_pptx`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for handling presentation slides (.pptx)
- [`sklearn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) for feature extraction and selection, baseline classifier, and model evaluation, etc.
- Used text dection algorithms by [`mmocr`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr) for visual preprocessing.
- [`torch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for machine learning model development.
- ðŸ¤— [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/models) for pre-trained model leveraging.

## Dataset

The dataset for analyzing the offer reference contains 26,485 slide images (size around **6 GB**). Approximately 14% of the total images were comprised of 3,763 images divided into **12 categories**. Samples were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure it was heterogeneous and representative of the entire dataset, considering attributes such as slide categories.
